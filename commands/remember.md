description: Store a memory with optional agent context and semantic embeddings
---

Store a new memory with semantic embeddings for later retrieval. Memories are automatically indexed for full-text and semantic search.

**Optional agent context:**
- `agentId`: Store memory in an agent-specific context
- `agentRole`: Define the agent's role (assistant, analyzer, etc.)
- `visibilityScope`: Control visibility (private, project, team, or global)
- `sector`: Classify memory type (episodic, semantic, procedural, etc.)
