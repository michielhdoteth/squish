description: Manage memory merge proposals (detect, list, preview, or get statistics)

Detect duplicate memories, list merge proposals, preview merge results, or view merge statistics. Use the `mode` parameter to select the operation.

**Modes:**
- `detect`: Scan for similar memories and create merge proposals
- `list`: View pending merge proposals for review
- `preview`: See the result of a merge without applying it
- `stats`: Get merge statistics (tokens saved, merge count, etc.)
